This repo presents the progress of ongoing research focused on the 
application of reinforcement learning algorithms for motion planning on
hexapod and quadruped robots. The primary objective is to develop
effective locomotion strategies by integrating reinforcement learning
techniques within simulated environments and transitioning them to
physical models.
During the initial phase, simulations were conducted using a pre-designed
hexapod robot in PyBullet, achieving successful motion planning and
movement. Building on this foundation, the research progressed to the
design and manufacture of a custom quadruped robot. With the quadruped
model now completed, future work will involve implementing a similar
reinforcement learning approach to enable the newly created robot to
achieve stable and adaptive locomotion.
The expected outcomes of this project include a fully functional quadruped and hexapod
robot capable of dynamic movement, validated through both simulation
and real-world testing, and insights into the adaptability of reinforcement
learning algorithms across different robotic platforms.
